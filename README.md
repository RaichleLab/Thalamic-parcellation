# Thalamic-parcellation
Yeo7_Buckner-Choi-Raut-combined_MNI152_3mm.nii.gz: NIFTI file (MNI152, 3mm) containing Yeo 7 RSN parcellation (Yeo et al., 2011) applied to thalamus as in Raut et al. (2020). For convenience, includes cerebellar parcellation from Buckner et al. (2011) and striatal parcellation from Choi et al. (2012).

Yeo7_Yeo-Buckner-Choi-Raut.dlabel.nii: Single CIFTI file that includes Yeo 7 RSN parcellation in cerebral cortex (Yeo et al., 2011), and this 7 RSN parcellation applied to thalamus (Raut et al., 2020), cerebellum (Buckner et al., 2011) and striatum (Choi et al., 2012). This CIFTI is in the standard HCP 91,282 "grayordinate" space (i.e., 32k_fs_LR surface vertices and 2mm MNI152 subcortical voxels) and can be applied out-of-the-box to HCP data.
